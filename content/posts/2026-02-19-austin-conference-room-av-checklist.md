## Quick answer
Before mounting any TV, verify wall structure, choose the right bracket type, set viewing height, and plan cable concealment.

## Step-by-step checklist
- Confirm TV size, VESA pattern, and mount compatibility
- Locate studs and avoid unsafe anchor-only installs for heavy TVs
- Set center height based on primary seating eye level
- Plan HDMI/power routing before drilling
- Level, tighten, and test movement (if full-motion)

## Common mistakes
- Mounting too high above fireplace without tilt compensation
- Ignoring glare/reflection from windows
- Leaving cable slack unmanaged behind mount arms

## FAQ
### Is full-motion always better?
No. Use it when side-angle viewing or frequent repositioning is needed.

### Can I conceal wires in all walls?
Not always; wall type and code-safe routing determine options.
