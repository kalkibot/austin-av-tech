## Quick answer
Start with room use-cases, user count, audio intelligibility, display size, control simplicity, and support ownership.

## Checklist
- Define room scenarios (daily standup, client demos, hybrid meetings)
- Set audio baseline (mic coverage + echo handling)
- Select display and camera based on room dimensions
- Define one-touch controls for non-technical users
- Assign support owner and maintenance cadence
